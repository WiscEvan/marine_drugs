## KEGG analysis (no amphimedon queenslandica filter)

kofamscan was used to annotate KEGG orthologs for the augustus annotated sponge proteins from each metagenome.

As a positive control, _Amphimedon queenslandica_ proteins were also annotated.

```{r no_filter_ko_hits}
df <- read_tsv(here("marine_drugs/marine_drugs/data/interim/host-annotation/kegg-analysis/ko_counts.long.tsv"))
```

```{r no_filter_ko_hits_heatmap, echo=TRUE}
df %>% ggplot(aes(x=))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
